Bharat Intern Internship Tasks Repository

This repository contains the tasks performed during the Machine Learning and Data Science Internships.

## Machine Learning Internship

- **Iris Flowers Classification:** ML model to predict the different species of flowers on the length of their petals and sepals.
- **Wine Quality Prediction:** Machine Learning model to predict the quality of wine using linear regression.


## Data Science Internship

- **Stock Prediction:** Model to take the stock price of any company and predict its price by using LSTM.
- **Number Recognition:** Handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits.
                        Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a significant project made with the help of Neural Networks.
                        It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits.
